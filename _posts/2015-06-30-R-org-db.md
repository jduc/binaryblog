The package Org.Mm.db (or the human version) contains a bunch of tables that allows easy conversion
from entrez ID to other annotations (ensembl, uniprot etc...). 

Basically, using mget, it is then possible to map entries into the other ones and to get a new table
with the corresponding names. 

Here is a quick example on how it works.

As show, the different tables are named with the convention: 
org.Mm.egENSEMBL. There is also reversed table for backward search (ensembl to entrez).
